						GMC's main objective is to change the financial status of people
						with one currency. A coin can be worth anywhere from $0.25 to
						$70000. There is also a currency where clients can use their own
						NFTs and real-world experience and create empowerment with
						monetization. GMC has several main purposes and uses. GEM is an
						entertainment-focused platform and NFT marketplace built around fans
						of cultural figures. On GEM, fans can interact with like-minded
						fans, attend virtual events, and add and collect utility-focused
						NFTs of their favorite celebrities, and create NFTs and experiences
						and platforms for profit. The white paper describes in detail.

						Here we will collect NFT from external NFT developers and GEM active
						account holders.
